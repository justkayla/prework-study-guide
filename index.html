        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The acronym HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Text, Image, Header, and List elements are commonly used to add content to pages.</li>
          <li>Meta-related, Content division, and Semantic elements are commonly used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The acronym CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of a webpage.</li>
          <li>CSS also defines style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and formats them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Inline styles are useful for quick and permanent changes, but are less flexible than internal/external style sheets.</li>
          <li>Each inline style must be edited individually whenever a design change is made.</li>
          <li>An internal CSS style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in particular HTML elements.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>          
          <li>Two important CSS terms are: margin and padding.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is the version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub related that happens locally on your computer.</li>
          <li>There are a lot of git commands that are used in coding.</li>
          <li>An example of a git command is git clone.</li>
          <li>git clone: clones a remote repository into a new directory on your local drive.</li>          
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name: changes the branch</li>
          <li>Use online git command cheat sheets to become familiar with git commands!</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>With JS, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more!</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JS reads code in order...so it's important to use the correct order.</li>
          <li>You can view console.log output by right-clicking your index.html in the browser and selecting "Inspect" from the menu.</li>
          <li>Emojis have character codes (you can look these up)!</li>
          <li>Remember that you have to link the script.js file to the index.html file like you did with style.css!</li>
          <li>We learned about "if" statements.</li>
          <li>("truthy" and "falsy" are funny terms)</li>
          <li>We learned about arrays and for loops.</li>
          <li>We learned how to write a basic function, and how to call that function.</li>
        </ul>
